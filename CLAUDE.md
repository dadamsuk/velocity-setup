This program is a CLI which is executed as a setup script to create a new application structure, with an empty app.  It supports all the features listed in @STACK.md.

It also includes a reference application, which was created by using the setup script.  The reference application is a simple notetaking app, allowing the user to create and edit notes.  It's very simple, just to show a running app.  


Apps will be deployed using Vercel or Coolify.
